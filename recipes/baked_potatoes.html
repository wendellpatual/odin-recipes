						To make baked potatoes, preheat the oven to 400 degrees and wash and dry 4-6 medium-sized russet potatoes. Use a fork to poke holes in the skin, then place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake for 45-60 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Let the potatoes cool, then cut off the top and carefully scoop out the insides, leaving a thin layer of potato flesh. Mash the scooped-out potato with butter, milk, salt, and pepper, then spoon the mixture back into the potato skins. Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until heated through and lightly browned. Serve with your choice of toppings such as sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, or chives.
