						Chicken Tikka Masala is a popular Indian dish made with marinated and grilled chicken in a spiced tomato cream sauce. To make Chicken Tikka Masala, start by marinating the chicken in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, and a blend of Indian spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Grill or broil the chicken until it is cooked through. In a separate pan, make the tomato cream sauce by sautéing onions, garlic, and ginger, and then adding canned tomatoes, heavy cream, and a blend of Indian spices. Add the cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer everything together until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is fully coated. Serve over rice or with naan bread.
