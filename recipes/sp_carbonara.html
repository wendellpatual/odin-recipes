						Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian dish made with spaghetti, eggs, bacon or pancetta, pecorino cheese, and black pepper. To make Spaghetti Carbonara, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. In a separate pan, cook the bacon or pancetta until it is crispy. In a bowl, beat together the eggs and pecorino cheese. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and add it to the pan with the bacon. Quickly pour the egg mixture over the spaghetti and toss everything together until the spaghetti is coated in the sauce. Serve hot, garnished with additional pecorino cheese and black pepper.
